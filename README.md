# Case Study: Transforming Raw Data into Compelling Impact Stories

### **What This Method Achieves for Your Organisation**

This case study demonstrates a method for using a supervised AI tool as an "interpretation layer"—a way to help you turn dry, factual data into the powerful, human stories needed for fundraising and stakeholder engagement.

*   **Connects your data to your mission** by intelligently reframing raw statistics into compelling narratives that highlight the human element of your work.
*   **Enhances fundraising effectiveness** by helping you generate more engaging, story-driven content for appeals, social media, and grant applications.
*   **Saves valuable team time** by performing the initial "first draft" of an impact story, allowing your fundraising and communications staff to focus on the higher-value work of refining and sharing it.

### **Practical, Real-World Use Cases**

This is a practical tool for any charity that needs to communicate its impact more effectively:

*   **Annual Impact Reports:** Transform a list of annual statistics (e.g., "served 500 beneficiaries," "ran 20 workshops") into a powerful narrative summary that explains the *so what* behind the numbers.
*   **Fundraising Appeals:** Take a dry, internal project update and automatically draft a compelling, story-driven appeal that focuses on a single beneficiary's journey.
*   **Social Media Content:** Create a series of engaging, short-form stories for social media by feeding the system a set of raw, positive beneficiary feedback comments.

### **The Technical Approach: A High-Level Look at the Method**

This workflow uses a supervised software tool to act as a "narrative analyst." The process is designed to find the human story *behind* the data.

1.  **Stage 1: We give the tool a single piece of factual data.** The process begins by providing the tool with a simple, factual statement. For example: `Statistic: We distributed 1,000 food parcels in the Leith area last month.`

2.  **Stage 2: We give it our "house style" rules.** Alongside the data, we provide a set of simple, clear guiding principles that define our organisation's storytelling voice. For example: `Guidance: A good story is about a person, not a number. A good story shows a challenge being overcome.`

3.  **Stage 3: The tool proposes a story "brief" for the team.** Based on the guidance, the tool is prompted to ask logical "why" questions about the data—such as, "Why is this statistic important?" or "What human need does this action serve?" The tool's final task is to deconstruct the raw data in light of this analysis. It proposes a richer "story brief" for the communications team. The output is not a finished story, but a structured starting point:
    *   **The Human Goal:** "To ensure no family has to choose between heating and eating."
    *   **The Obstacle:** "The rising cost of living is putting unprecedented strain on local families."
    *   **The Impact:** "The food parcels are not just about food; they are a vital point of human contact for isolated individuals."

This provides a powerful, high-quality starting point for your team to tell a story that truly resonates with supporters.
